<h3>Week 01-- Tuesday</h3>



 1.- Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages <br/>


* Compiled languages: (C++, Go) are converted directly into machine native code by a compiler program.


* Interpreted Languages: in interpreted languages (Python, JavaScript), there are no build steps. Instead, interpreters operate on the source code of the program while executing it.
```
   
2.- Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both? 



Answer:
```

Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter. The use of compiled byte-code allows the interpreter (the virtual machine) to be small and efficient (and nearly as fast as the CPU running native, compiled code). 
```


 3.- Pseudocode Currency Converter exercise (a program to determine if a number is greater than 50)
  ```


   1- Start
   2- A < -- 10
   3- Z < -- A > 50
   4- PRINT Z
   5- END
   ```


 4- Learn about High and Low level languages
 ```



A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages.
```

In contrast, assembly languages are considered low-level because they are very close to machine languages.
```


Examples of used high-level languages:
```

Python.
Java.
C++
C#
Visual Basic.
JavaScript.
```
